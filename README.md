a longterm game idea which i want to make 

need to make a new map for the main area which can have different interaction with various characters

have interactable characters.. the fight mechanica and boss battle 

the boss battle is a 2 d one 

maybe its time to change the code into a real game development engeine..

throughout this development process i found various things about game dev. like 1 charater movement is easy, charater animation is easy, game physics, enemy automatic movement, is hard..
i also found that enemy battle are done with help of path finding algorithm, so descreet math is important.

i found why making separate file for saperate concept is better than all code at same file... it becomes completely messy,
